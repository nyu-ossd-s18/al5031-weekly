# Week 12 Blog Post

# Qute Browser Progress

This week, I focused on the pragmatic approach of finding and solving bugs; what I mean by this is that I dedicate a special 
sit down to use my downloaded developer version of Qute Browser and try to find ANY problems/bugs that I would be able to identify on 
the issue board. I ended up submitting an issue which comprised of two small bugs - there was a certain command that gave unwanted
behavior both on Mac and Linux.

Here is the issue submission (which was recently closed without making changes): https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/3850

Our team friend, @TheCompiler, said it wasn't necessary to code in a change as it would cause confusion - I do not think that is right but in the end,
it is their application and I am happy to have received an explanation as to why they closed it (after some debate).

My individual contributions for my team:
- 2 issue submissions
- 1 PR
- 1 PR merged!
- Lots of discussion on IRC with @TheCompiler (participation and involvement with project lead)
