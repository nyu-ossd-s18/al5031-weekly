# Week 9 - Blog Post


# 3 Questions for Danna (Google Software Engineer)

- How does Google view open source?
- What is your perspective on Google's privacy policies as an employee?
- How can Google increase paticipation in open source rituals?

# Group Progress

- Our team is in the process of submitting issues onto the actual Qute Browser repo. For one, their instructions to set up development build are super patchy and are not detailed enough; I think this will be our first issue submission but we should also get some issues up where we can contribute code. 
- As an individual, I am stuck in a bit of a learning curb as I am trying to go through Github which I had little exposure to before and this project mainly uses Python which I have really not worked with before. 
- My specific contributions would be that I keep the project board clean and updated so that we can track our progress long term and also contribute more efficiently to Qute by labeling and setting up a bit of Scrum frameworks to this open source project.

# Open Data Events
- I will attend the event 'Talk Data To Me' that is scheduled to take place this upcoming Thursday, April 5th.
