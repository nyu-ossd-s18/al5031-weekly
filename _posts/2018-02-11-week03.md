# Week 3 Blog Post


- I actually had a pretty difficult time selecting something I wanted to contribute new. This was a humbling exercise as one tends
to think they know a lot (or everything) on a lot (or everything); I wanted to contribute to a lot of things (favorite shows, Mexico page, favorite artists, etc)
but I found that Wikipedia is not very user-friendly for contributors and I never wanted to add anything either way because I did not want to add anything
that was not based on fact. I ended up looking to want to contribute by way of correcting grammar (mostly punctuation) but again I was frustrated by Wikipedia's 
U/I for contributors, I found myself surfing tons of Wikipedia paths that each page I was looking to contribute to led me. So I needed to select 
something that I was damn sure would be based on fact and new.

- Thus, I selected my father's Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gast√≥n_Luken_Garza). I made a contribution in the Politics tab on the fact that he ran
for mayor of my hometown, Tijuana, this past summer. If I knew anything about anything, I knew about this campaign. It was hard not to be biased in my contribution,
but even if there is a hint of bias in it, the entirety of it is fact. I was sure to also include a reputable source.
