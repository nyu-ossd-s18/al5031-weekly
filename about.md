# A Little Bit About Alvaro

- My name is Alvaro Luken Luna.

- At NYU, I am the founder and president of Blockchain Lab @ NYU - a research focused club aiming to empower students and faculty with knowledge of blockchain technology. I also like to work with Latino groups at NYU.

- I am an open-minded, creative and curiosity-driven thinker. I consider myself a hardcore pragmatist; I genuinely enjoy solving all kinds of problems and puzzles. I hail from the border town of Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. I'm looking to bring change to the world by bringing change to my country of Mexico and beyond. I'm immensely interested and curious in and about many subjects - I play three instruments, love reading biographies and love discussing new ideas and history.

- My programming skills are, admittedly and honestly, not the best. But I work hard to learn quickly.

- I think that open source programming is going to be my own way of contributing to humanitarian projects. I have always liked the idea of being able to work remotely and make a change.

- Blockchain technology really interests me and I feel like we are living at just the beginning of the technical revolution it will cause. Within blockchain, I like the mining aspect of it - I am a miner personally - using a computer I built myself over the course of a few months.

- I work on many projects all the time, feel free to ask me about them!
